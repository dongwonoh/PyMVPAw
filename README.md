Edits &amp; additions to PyMVPA http://www.pymvpa.org/

##Purpose
These are personal edits and custom changes to PyMVPA as used by our lab. They include mostly (1) new functions / analyses, and (2) code that streamlines the process of using PyMVPA by packaging large amounts of code into easy functions.

##Contents

###Files
* dataload.py - Sets up initial environment in python, importing modules and readying data
* dset_manage.py - functions handling datasets (e.g., saving them to nifti)
* wrapit_pymvpa.py - conglomeration of functions for various purposes in classification and RSA (see below)
* plotter.py - functions for quick plotting results
* rsa.py - copy of RSA measure from PyMVPA with additional functions being added, e.g., partial correlation RSA
* pcorr.py - partial correlation code

###Functions
In progress
